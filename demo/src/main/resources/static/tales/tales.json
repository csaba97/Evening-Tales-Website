    "title": "The Forest Princess",
    "description": "A long time ago, in a big beautiful forest there lived many animals. The animals in the forest were happy and they lived a wonderful life. One reason that the animals were happy was because in the forest there also lived a little princess. The little princess had long curly, blonde hair. Do you know what her name was? It might surprise you but her name was Marina! Yes, Marina, a beautiful name for a beautiful little princess. Every morning she would go to the park near the river to play with her friends. Mrs. Rabbit, Mr. Skunk and the very young deer were her best friends. One day they were playing together. They were having so much fun that they lost track of the time. The sun went down and it became dark. The little animals were afraid to go home alone. Princess Marina had an idea. She said, Why don't you all come to my Grandpa's home with me. Grandpa doesn't mind it when I bring my friends to his place. When Marina and her friends arrived at her grandpa's house her invited them in. He gave them all the treats that they could eat. After they ate they all played games. After a time Grandpa in a deep loud voice said, It's time for bed now. Grandpa gathered all the friends around and told them a bedtime story. Before long everyone was fast asleep. In the morning it was safe for the animals to go home. Everyday Marina and her friends still play but now they make sure that they go home before it gets dark."

    "title": "Always Listen",
    "description": "Many moons ago there was a folk tale passed down from generation to generation. The story is about the Cho-Cho Man or the Boogie Man. It all began with a young boy named Dakota. Dakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire. The nights were getting cooler. Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough sunlight left to do two things. He would gather the firewood after he played with his friends Morgan, Joey, and Bo. Not long after, his mother began to wonder why Dakota never came with any firewood. Night had fallen fast and it was too hard to see the firewood. Dakota realized what had happened. He told his friends about his predicament and they said that they would help their friend. Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the dark. Dakota's mother was worried that something had happened. She went looking for Dakota. Not long after, she heard the boys. She had mixed feelings. She was happy to see Dakota but she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother. She wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very quietly. Then she picked up a twig and threw it. The twig hit the ground making noise. It caught the boys' attention. She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction. The boys jumped. The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan sounded through her fingers. The boys were definitely scared. But Dakota was the brave one. He ventured forward. The mother moaned again; she threw another twig. The boys were transfixed. Once more the mother moaned in a low and deep voice, \"Listen to your mother.\" The boys dropped everything and ran. The mother could not hold back her laughter and the boys, hearing this, scurried home even faster. After the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found Dakota in tears. Dakota exclaimed, \"Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.\" His mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry. From then on when Dakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, \"The boogie-man will scare you if you misbehave.\""

    "title": "The Lonely Dinosaur",
    "description": "Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth. Some were very large and others small. They also came in many different colors. Behind the fiery mountains was a valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day. One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer. A new dinosaur that the other dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by. He stopped and watched and then he asked, \" Could I play too?\" All of the other dinosaurs looked at him. Together in one giant voice they said \" NO!\" The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others. He had a long neck and he was green. None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked, green dinosaur. The new dinosaur was very sad because everyone said no to him and they even called him 'Greeny'. His feelings were hurt. Slowly he sat down and sadly watched the others play. Time went by and then suddenly they all stopped playing soccer and they all looked up. One of the dinosaurs had kicked their only ball into a tree. The ball was too high for them to reach. But it was not too high for the long necked, green dinosaur. He walked over and said to the other dinosaurs, \"If I can get your ball down will you let me play with you?\" The other dinosaurs decided that it was a good idea. The long necked, green dinosaur reached up with his long neck and he easily got the ball down. Once again they began playing again. They had a great time playing soccer. The other dinosaurs said they were sorry for not letting him play with them and calling him names. They had all learned a lesson that day. Even though others may look different we should accept them. We all have something special about us. The lonely dinosaur now had many friends and they played in the valley for many more years."

    "title": "The Five Little Stars",
    "description": "She closed her eyes and made a wish. She wished she could have five little stars. She wished they were hers to hold in her hands, to keep close to her heart and to care for and to love forever. When she opened her eyes, something caught her eye. There were five twinkling stars all in a row. She knew these would be hers when the time was right. They would be there waiting. Time passed and when the time was right her first little star came to her. She knew this star was a boy so she named him Gabriel. He was so beautiful. She was so happy. This was the most wonderful feeling that she had ever known. This little star was hers to keep. She took him in her hands and took care of him. She loved him with all of her heart. Gabriel gave her so much joy in her life; she loved every minute of it. Some time passed and the second little star came to her. She also knew this star would be a boy; she named him Javier. And as with the first star, she took him in her hands and she held him close to her heart. She took care of him and loved him as much as she did her first star. Javier was such a beautiful star. She couldn't believe her eyes. The young woman was so thrilled to have two stars to love with all of her heart. Each time she thought of them her eyes filled with tears of joy. Some time after, another little star came to her. This one was also a boy so she named him James. She took her new little star in her hands and she held him close to her heart. She cared for him and loved him as much as her first two little stars. He was so gorgeous she couldn't believe this little star was also hers to keep. Now she had three little stars to care for. She loved them all so very much. She watched them grow and she admired them every day. She would take them out and show them to the world. As she enjoyed and took care of them, the years went by. She was in shock when the last two little stars that she had wished for came to her at the same time. She could hardly believe her good fortune. She had always wanted all boys but when she had made her wish so long ago she had thought that this was too much to ask. The two new tiny stars were named Andrew and Adam Her other little stars: Gabriel, Javier and James were so overwhelmed with joy that they wanted to help all the time. The lady's heart was filled with joy. She took her new little stars in her hands. She held them close to her heart and she cared for them. These two new stars were so tiny and beautiful. She had so much love in her. She had enough to give all of them the love they needed. They were all part of her life. They were hers to keep and love forever. As her five little stars grew, she would always tell them that she loved them all the same and she always would. She promised that she would be there for them whenever they would  need her, just as they were there for her when she needed them. Her wish had come true; having five little stars was a joy. Now she knows deep inside that when the time is right she would have to let go. But even at that time she will always hold them close to her heart and she'll be there when they need a hug."

One day Jim had to go to the city for some business. He put on his tall, tall hat. Jim always wore a tall, tall hat wherever he went. Jim knew that if he left John alone he would most likely get into things that he shouldn't. Jim didn't like to leave John alone and Jim knew he had to take John with him to the city. Jim and John got in Jim's car and drove to the city. John was very excited because he hadn't been to the big city before. The closer the car got to the city, the more exited John got. Finally they came to the hotel. Jim told John to stay in the car. Jim talked to the man at the front desk and he booked a room for two. Jim went to see how John was doing. When Jim went to the car, the car was gone. Jim was frightened. He didn't know what to do. A policeman came walking by just at that time. Jim was happy to see him. He ran to the policeman and said; \"My car is missing and John is in it.\" The policeman said, \"I just saw a yellow car go rolling down the hill and there wasn't a driver!\" Jim was worried about what had happened to John and the car. The policeman asked Jim what had happened. Jim thought to himself. Then he remembered that he had just had his brakes checked and the man had said the brakes needed some work done very soon. Just then another policeman came running. \"I just saw a yellow car go down the hill.\" Both the policemen and Jim went running down the hill. At the bottom they saw the car resting on the curb. \"Whew! Are we lucky,\" said Jim. Jim was very happy at first but he wasn't happy very long. He didn't see John anywhere. He looked and looked but John wasn't anywhere to be found. Then as Jim turned around, out of the corner of his eye he saw John sitting in a tree. John looked very scared. Jim went over to the tree to help John. Another policeman said he had seen John running from the car after it had hit the curb. Jim was happy that John wasn't hurt. Together they went over to see if the car was all right. John and Jim took the car to the garage and got the car fixed. They both went to the hotel to pick their things up. Jim and John went back to the country. That was where John was most happy."

They walked until they came to another guy named Brian. Brian asked them where they were going. The elf said, \"We are going for a walk in the forest. Would you like to come?\" Brian said, \" No thank you. I hear from Mat's friends that the bushes were wild and the grass is pretty high and the water is pretty deep.\" The elf replied, \"I just told him those things. But really they are not as bad as I said they are. You can ask Mat yourself. This is Mat.\" But Brian said, \" I will pass on that.\" The elf said, \"OK with me. We'll go ourselves.

    "description": "Once upon a time there was a little boy named Peter. He lived with his grandmother. His\r\ngrandmother went blind when she got older. From a young age, Peter had to look after his\r\ngrandmother. He grew up to be a kind, gentle and patient person. He worked very hard.\r\nIn Peter's country lived a king who was powerful and kind. The king had a daughter. His\r\ndaughter was very pretty. The king worried about his daughter. He thought about his\r\ndaughter every minute of every day. The king wanted his daughter to be happy and he\r\nwanted her to marry a good husband.\r\nAs time went by, the princess grew up. She became more beautiful with each passing day.\r\nHer father, the king, thought hard about his daughter's future. The king wondered what he\r\nwould have to do.\r\nOne day he had an idea. He sent the news all over his kingdom and he sent the\r\nannouncement to other countries too. The announcement read, \" There will be a special\r\narchery tournament. The man who wins this special archery tournament will claim the prize.\r\nThis prize is to marry the king's daughter.\"\r\nAll the people were excited. When Peter heard the news, he wanted to go to the archery\r\ntournament very much. He was very good at archery. He was so excited about the\r\ntournament that he couldn't drink and he couldn't eat. When he went to sleep, he dreamed\r\nabout it. When he awoke, he thought about it. He was excited.\r\nAt the same time he was sad, too, because he was so small and ugly. His grandmother\r\nasked him why he sounded so sad. All he did was sigh and answer, \"I'm okay;\r\ngrandmother.\"\r\nHis grandmother knew that he was sad and she asked him again and again.\r\nFinally he explained to his grandmother that he had heard the news about the king's\r\ntournament. He told her how he felt. His grandmother said, \"You are good at that game.\r\nWhy don't you try it?\"\r\n\"I know I'm good at archery, but maybe some of them are better them me.\"\r\n\"Don't give up.\" his grandmother said, \"You can do it\"\r\nPeter said to his grandmother, \"But if I win the game, I don't think princess would marry\r\nme.\"\r\nHis grandmother told him; \"It doesn't matter if she marries you or not. Just try to be as\r\ngood as you can at the games.\"\r\nHe thought for awhile. Suddenly Peter said \"You're right grandmother. I will try it.\"\r\nPeter trained himself. Soon he was ready for the game. On the day of the games he got\r\nready to leave for the castle early in the morning. He wasn't happy about leaving his\r\ngrandmother alone. He was worried about her. But his grandmother told him he had to go.\r\nBefore he left, his grandmother gave him a red rose. \"After you win, give this rose to the\r\nprincess. But before you give this to her, close your eyes and smell it's beauty. Be strong\r\nand be brave and win the game.\"\r\nHe said good bye and left his grandmother and went to the castle.\r\nWhen he arrived, Peter saw the big castle. There were many people there. He was afraid to\r\ngo in. Peter thought and thought. He almost went back to his grandmother and then he\r\nheard his grandmother's words again. Peter knew he could not turn back. He went across\r\nthe castle's bridge and through the castle's large gate.\r\nInside he saw even more people. There were soldiers all around him. He was so afraid.\r\nEverybody was excited about the game.\r\nPeter stood in line waiting for the game to start. He felt that everybody was looking at him\r\nstrangely because he wasn't a prince or a knight or anyone important.\r\nThe buzz of shopkeepers selling their wares and people talking and guessing who would win\r\nfilled the streets. What kind of person was going to marry the princess? Would it be a knight\r\nor perhaps a prince?\r\nThere were many excellent archers at the tournament. Peter nervously waited for his turn.\r\nFinally the judge called his name. Peter stepped forward. He placed an arrow on his bow. He\r\npulled the string, aimed and released the arrow. It flew through the air and it hit the target.\r\nThe crowd gasped. Peter looked and he could not believe it. Peter had been lucky. He had\r\nwon the prize. Nobody thought that Peter was going to win.\r\nSlowly Peter walked to the front. He stood in front of the king and the princess. With his\r\neyes looking down he offered the rose to the princess. But before he gave her the rose, he\r\nsmelled its beauty, just like his grandmother had told him.\r\nMagically, Peter turned into a strong, tall and handsome man. Everybody was surprised,\r\nincluding the king and his daughter. Peter and the princess married and lived happy ever\r\nafter."

    "description": "One day, JD, Brenda and I were watching TV and we saw an ad on TV. The carnival was in\r\ntown on August 8-14. JD and Brenda said, \"Can we go this year, Mom?\"\r\nI smiled at them and said, \" Yes, this year we will go.\"\r\nThe children and I saved our money. When August came around we went to the carnival at\r\nthe Exhibition Grounds. We were excited. The children wanted to see all the animals at the\r\ncarnival. They wanted to see the tigers with their two-colored coats, the elephants, the\r\nbears, the wolves and the unicorns.\r\nWe started to walk. The first animals we saw were the orange and black tigers and the\r\nwhite and black tigers. The big cats put on a performance for us.\r\nI said to the children, \"The orange and black tiger looks like Tigger. See the way he walked\r\nacross and pounced down off the stand. It looked like he wanted to talk to his mom and the\r\nother two tigers. They look like young tigers. Look the white and black and the orange and\r\nblack tigers are talking to you.\" JD and Brenda were really excited.\r\nThen the tiger that look like Tigger began to talk to me, \"How come you say that I look like\r\nTigger?\" asked the tiger.\r\nI was surprised that he was talking to me. \" I - I think you look like Tigger because of the\r\nway you walked and pounced off the stands. You remind me of the cartoon of Tigger. You\r\npounce like he pounces in the forest.\r\nJust then the two young tigers, the ones that were white and black, started talking to JD. \"It\r\nmust be nice to have freedom. You are out in the world. You are not stuck in a cage and\r\nmade to go from town to cities.\"\r\nJD looked at the tigers and said, \"Yes it is nice to be free. But still it must be nice to travel.\r\nWe don't travel around much to different cities or towns.\"\r\nThe other orange and black tiger started to talk toward Brenda, \"Are you having fun looking\r\nand talking to all the animals?\"\r\nBrenda replied, \"Yes, we are having fun. But we haven't seen all the animals yet.\"\r\nI heard my daughter's conversation and said, \"Come let's go see the bears and then the\r\nelephants.\"\r\n\"Yes. Let's!\" Brenda and JD said.\r\nWe said goodbye to the tigers and we walked on to see the bears in their cages.\r\nAfter, we went to the elephant's cages. We stopped and talked with the elephants. We\r\nasked the elephants how they liked being in the carnival and how old they were. One\r\nelephant said that she was about fifty years old and the other one said he was about\r\ntwenty-five years old. They said that they had been in the carnival for all of their lives.\r\nOur next stop was at the wolves. We all like wolves so once again we stopped to talk with\r\nthem. The wolves talked to JD and Brenda. They told us that they had only been in the\r\ncarnival for a few years. They were surprised to see how many people like to see the\r\ndifferent animals. But they were sad that not many people stopped to talk.\r\n\"So, do you guys like us?\" the wolves asked.\r\nJD and Brenda said, \"Yes of course. We like wolves very much. But we are sorry we can't\r\nstay and talk longer. It's getting late and we still have to go to see the unicorns. They are\r\nthe most beautiful animals of all. Thank you for talking with us. Goodbye.\"\r\nOff we went to see the unicorns. The unicorns had over heard the children saying that they\r\nthought that unicorns were such beautiful animals. Before anyone could say anything, the\r\nunicorns thanked the children. \"You know many people do not believe in us and because of\r\nthat they can never see us.\"\r\n\"Oh we believe in you and we find you to be the most fantastic animals. But it's so late now\r\nand we have to go\"\r\nJD, Brenda and I thanked the unicorns. As we started to leave, the unicorns called out to\r\nthe other animals, \"Let's all say good bye.\"\r\nOne unicorn said, \"I will count to three and we will say good bye.\" And he began to count, \"\r\nOne, two, three.\"\r\nAnd with a loud noise that almost sounded like thunder, all of the animals said good-bye\r\nand good night.\r\nIt had been a very special day for us. We had often talked to the animals but this was the\r\nfirst time that the animals had talked to us."

That's why\r\nwe aren't able to have the things that others have.\" The children understood and didn't ever\r\nask again.\r\nTheir parents sent them to the car to go to bed. It was the next day and it was the mother's\r\nturn to go out and see if anyone would hire her. There was no luck at all. So the mother and\r\nfather sat down and talked about what they could try to do about the problems and make\r\ntheir children's dream come true.\r\nThat day a rich man, by the name of Joe, came into town. Joe had so much money in his\r\npockets that he didn't know what to do with it all. Joe was the kind of person that couldn't\r\nhave children. He wished that one day he could have children. He thought about adopting\r\nchildren some day. He wasn't quite sure what to do. Joe' had a heart of gold. He never\r\nthought about himself; he was always thinking of others and what they need.\r\nAs he was driving along this night he noticed a family of four. They were picking through the\r\ngarbage for food; to keep warm they stood by a flaming garbage bin. He noticed that they\r\nwere wearing rags. Their faces were dirty and their hair was messed really badly. Joe\r\nwalked by and thought some more about what he should do.\r\nThe next day the mother and father went out to look for work. It was coming close to\r\nChristmas Eve and they wanted to try to find work once more before everything had closed.\r\nDoor to door they went. Every where they went they were booted out, rejected, and doors\r\nslammed in their faces.\r\nJoe was to witness this and he felt really badly. He couldn't believe how selfish the people\r\nwho lived in town were. Joe wanted to do something about it. He thought for awhile, then\r\nhe realized this family had something that he wanted and that was a family. Joe had\r\nsomething that they wanted. This was a home.\r\nSo Joe decided he would approach them. \"I have been watching you since I came into town.\r\nI have seen you and your wife trying to make a living but when you have not been able to\r\nfind work, you can't make a living that way. I've been thinking for couple of days. I have\r\nsomething you want. This is a home. You have something that I want. This is a family.\r\nI want to invite you into my home for Christmas. After Christmas if you want to be a part of\r\nmy family or should I say if I could be apart of your family, we can discuss it\" The family\r\nsaid, \"Yes!\" After Christmas they all agreed that they should become a family. The children\r\nbegan school. The parents got a job and they lived happy ever after."

There were high mountains surrounding the meadow.\r\nThe people in the village often told tales that something evil lived in the meadow. The\r\npeople told tales of mysterious creatures. People from the near by village were frightened\r\nby the tales. Most would not go into the meadow.\r\nThere was only one person, Tannus was her name, who did not fear the stories. Her\r\ngrandmother had told her about the strange creature that the people feared. She had told\r\nTannus that this creature was special and only people who believed would see it. Her\r\ngrandmother had called it a unicorn. Tannus remembered this story. She would go to the\r\nmeadow and to look for the unicorn but she had never seen it.

When Tannus saw it she remembered something more from\r\nGrandmother's story. The unicorn's horn was said to have magic powers. Grandmother had\r\nsaid that if a person touches it she would receive three wishes.\r\nTannus looked at the beautiful unicorn. She slowly walked toward it. She reached out her\r\nhand and stroked its mane gently.\r\nThe unicorn knelt and allowed Tannus to get on its back. Together they rode to the village.\r\nWhen Tannus's mother saw them she called out, \"Get off that wild thing!\"\r\nTannus said, \" No! It's not wild mother. All that he needs is a friend. He needs some love.\r\nMom, come for a ride with me?\"\r\nMother said, \"No, Tannus! We don't know anything about him. What does he eat?\"\r\n\"He eats grass. Grandmother told me about him when I was young. She told me that I\r\ncould make a wish if I touch its horn and that the wish would come true.\r\nTannus touched its horn and she made a wish. She wished for a castle. Suddenly the castle\r\nappeared. It had solid gold trim. The ballroom floor was made out of pearls. The pillars were\r\nsolid gold.\r\nTannus wished a second time. This time she wished for more unicorns so that her unicorn\r\ncould be happy for the rest of his life and then there were more unicorns walking and\r\nplaying in the meadow.\r\nShe made a third wish and she wished for a prince for herself and the prince appeared.

When he tried to enter, the boy blocked his path. \u201CWho\r\nare you and why are you blocking my path?\u201D demanded Lord Shiva. \u201CNo one enters my\r\nmother\u2019s chamber\u201D, declared the boy boldly. Taken aback, Lord Shiva replied, \u201CStep away; I\r\nhave the right to enter my wife\u2019s chamber.\u201D But the young and courageous boy did not\r\nmove but stood his ground. Not knowing that this was his own son, Lord Shiva who was\r\nquick to anger grew enraged. Not used to be disobeyed he cut off the boy\u2019s head.\r\nGoddess Parvathi on returning from her bath saw her son lying dead and was overcome\r\nwith grief. She was filled with both anger and sorrow. Seeing this Lord Shiva sent his soldiers\r\nto fetch the head of the first beast that they saw. The men rushed and finally came upon an\r\nelephant. They immediately took the head to Lord Shiva, who quickly attached it onto the\r\nbody of the slain boy and gave him life once again.To further appease his grief-stricken wife he promised that her son would be worshipped\r\nfirst, before all other Gods.\r\nEven today at the entrance of all temples one would find the idol of the elephant-headed\r\nGod, Lord Ganesha."

    "title": "THE PRAYING HANDS",
    "description": "Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen\r\nchildren. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and\r\nhead of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at\r\nhis trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood. Despite their\r\nseemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder\u2019s children had a dream. They\r\nboth wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would\r\nnever be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the\r\nAcademy.After many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally\r\nworked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines\r\nand, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that\r\nbrother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in\r\nthe mines.They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the\r\ntoss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the\r\nnext four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate\r\nsensation. Albrecht\u2019s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most\r\nof his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees\r\nfor his commissioned works.When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family\r\nheld a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht\u2019s triumphant homecoming. After a\r\nlong and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his\r\nhonored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the\r\nyears of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were,\r\n\u201CAnd now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to\r\nNuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.\u201DAll heads turned in eager\r\nexpectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face,\r\nshaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over,\r\n\u201CNo \u2026no \u2026no \u2026no.\u201D\r\nFinally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at\r\nthe faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, \u201CNo,\r\nbrother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look \u2026 looks what four years in the\r\nmines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once,\r\nand lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even\r\nhold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with\r\na pen or a brush. No, brother \u2026 for me it is too late.\u201D\r\nMore than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer\u2019s hundreds of masterful portraits,\r\npen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings\r\nhang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people,\r\nare familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer\u2019s works. More than merely being familiar with\r\nit, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.\r\nOne day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly\r\ndrew his brother\u2019s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He\r\ncalled his powerful drawing simply \u201CHands,\u201D but the entire world almost immediately\r\nopened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love \u201CThe Praying\r\nHands.\u201DThe next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your\r\nreminder, if you still need one, that no one \u2013 no one \u2013 - ever makes it alone!\r\nRemember, it is not the burdens of life that weigh us down; it is how we handle them."

When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you out this time!\u201D replied the 2nd wife. \u201CAt the very most, I can only\r\nsend you to your grave.\u201D The answer came like a bolt of thunder and the merchant was\r\ndevastated.\r\nThen a voice called out: \u201CI\u2019ll leave with you. I\u2019ll follow you no matter where you go.\u201D The\r\nmerchant looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered\r\nfrom malnutrition. Greatly grieved, the merchant said, \u201CI should have taken much better\r\ncare of you while I could have!\u201D\r\nActually, we all have 4 wives in our lives\r\na. The 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look\r\ngood, it\u2019ll leave us when we die.\r\nb. Our 3rd wife? Our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others.\r\nc. The 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us\r\nwhen we\u2019re alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave.\r\nd. The 1st wife is in fact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and\r\nsensual pleasure.\r\nGuess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it\u2019s a good\r\nidea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we\u2019re on our deathbed to\r\nlament\r\n"

Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the\r\nothers, doing its best to catch up\u2026. \u201CI want that one,\u201D the little boy said, pointing to the\r\nrunt.\r\nThe farmer knelt down at the boy\u2019s side and said, \u201CSon, you don\u2019t want that puppy. He will\r\nnever be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would.\u201D With that the little boy\r\nstepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In\r\ndoing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a\r\nspecially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, \u201CYou see sir, I don\u2019t run too\r\nwell myself, and he will need someone who understands.\u201D\r\nThe world is full of people who need someone who understands."

As they were walking\r\nalong by its side a countryman passed them and said: \"You fools, what is a Donkey for but to\r\nride upon?\"\r\nSo the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a\r\ngroup of men, one of whom said: \"See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he\r\nrides.\"\r\nSo the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when\r\nthey passed two women, one of whom said to the other: \"Shame on that lazy lout to let his\r\npoor little son trudge along.\"Well, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up before him on the\r\nDonkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point\r\nat them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said:\r\n\"Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking\r\nson?\"\r\nThe Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, till\r\nat last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey\r\nto their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to\r\nMarket Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the\r\nBoy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his forefeet\r\nbeing tied together he was drowned.\r\n\"That will teach you,\" said an old man who had followed them:\r\nPlease all, and you will please none\r\n"

    "description": "A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and a four-year old grandson. The\r\nold man's hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate\r\ntogether nightly at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing\r\nsight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped\r\nthe glass often milk spilled on the tablecloth. The son and daughter-in-law became irritated\r\nwith the mess. \"We must do something about grandfather,\" said the son. I've had enough of\r\nhis spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor. So the husband and wife set a small\r\ntable in the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner\r\nat the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a\r\nwooden bowl. Sometimes when the family glanced in grandfather's direction, he had a tear\r\nin his eye as he ate alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp\r\nadmonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in\r\nsilence.\r\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the\r\nfloor. He asked the child sweetly, \"What are you making?\" Just as sweetly, the boy\r\nresponded, \"Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I\r\ngrow up.\" The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents\r\nthat they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word\r\nwas spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfather's\r\nhand and gently led him back to the family table.For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason,\r\nneither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled,\r\nor the tablecloth soiled. Children are remarkably perceptive. Their eyes ever observe, their\r\nears ever listen, and their minds ever process the messages they absorb. If they see us\r\npatiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members, they will imitate that\r\nattitude for the rest of their lives. The wise parent realizes that every day that building\r\nblocks are being laid for the child's future.\r\nLet us all be wise builders and role models. Take care of yourself, ... and those you love, ...\r\ntoday, and everyday!\r\n"

    "title": "TREES THAT WOOD",
    "description": "Once there were three trees on a hill in the woods. They were discussing their hopes and\r\ndreams when the first tree said, \"Someday I hope to be a treasure chest. I could be filled\r\nwith gold, silver and precious gems. I could be decorated with intricate carving and\r\neveryone would see the beauty.\"\r\nThen the second tree said, \"Someday I will be a mighty ship. I will take kings and queens\r\nacross the waters and sail to the corners of the world. Everyone will feel safe in me because\r\nof the strength of my hull.\"\r\nFinally the third tree said, \"I want to grow to be the tallest and straightest tree in the forest.\r\nPeople will see me on top of the hill and look up to my branches, and think of the heavens\r\nand God and how close to them I am reaching. I will be the greatest tree of all time and\r\npeople will always remember me.\"\r\nAfter a few years of praying that their dreams would come true, a group of woodsmen came\r\nupon the trees. When one came to the first tree he said, \"This looks like a strong tree, I think\r\nI should be able to sell the wood to a carpenter\" ... and he began cutting it down. The tree\r\nwas happy, because he knew that the carpenter would make him into a treasure chest.\r\nAt the second tree a woodsman said, \"This looks like a strong tree, I should be able to sell it\r\nto the shipyard.\" The second tree was happy because he knew he was on his way to\r\nbecoming a mighty ship.When the woodsmen came upon the third tree, the tree was frightened because he knew\r\nthat if they cut him down his dreams would not come true. One of the woodsmen said, \"I\r\ndon't need anything special from my tree so I'll take this one\", and he cut it down.\r\nWhen the first tree arrived at the carpenters, he was made into a feed box for animals. He\r\nwas then placed in a barn and filled with hay. This was not at all what he had prayed for. The\r\nsecond tree was cut and made into a small fishing boat. His dreams of being a mighty ship\r\nand carrying kings had come to an end. The third tree was cut into large pieces and left\r\nalone in the dark. The years went by, and the trees forgot about their dreams.\r\nThen one day, a man and woman came to the barn. She gave birth and they placed the baby\r\nin the hay in the feed box that was made from the first tree. The man wished that he could\r\nhave made a crib for the baby, but this manger would have to do. The tree could feel the\r\nimportance of this event and knew that it had held the greatest treasure of all time. Years\r\nlater, a group of men got in the fishing boat made from the second tree. One of them was\r\ntired and went to sleep. While they were out on the water, a great storm arose and the tree\r\ndidn't think it was strong enough to keep the men safe. The men woke the sleeping man,\r\nand he stood and said \"Peace\" and the storm stopped. At this time, the tree knew that it\r\nhad carried the King of Kings in its boat.\r\nFinally, someone came and got the third tree. It was carried through the streets as the\r\npeople mocked the man who was carrying it. When they came to a stop, the man was nailed\r\nto the tree and raised in the air to die at the top of a hill. When Sunday came, the tree came\r\nto realize that it was strong enough to stand at the top of the hill and be as close to God as\r\nwas possible, because Jesus had been crucified on it.\r\nThe moral of this story is that when things don't seem to be going your way, always know\r\nthat God has a plan for you. If you place your trust in Him, He will give you great gifts. Each\r\nof the trees got what they wanted, just not in the way they had imagined. We don't always\r\nknow what God's plans are for us. We just know that His ways are not our ways, but His\r\nways are always best."

Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private\r\nstudy. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how\r\nmuch he loved him. He handed his son a beautifully wrapped gift box. Curious, but\r\nsomewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound\r\nBible, with the young man's name embossed in gold.

First, rivers dried up, then\r\npeople, animals, plants, and finally, the whole country became a desert. The cloud did not\r\ncare much, but she also did not realize that by being over a desert there was no place where\r\nshe could obtain new water to keep growing. So slowly, the cloud began to lose size, and\r\nwas unable to do anything to stop it .\r\nThe cloud then realized her mistake, and that her greed and selfishness were the cause of\r\nher vanishing; but just before evaporating, when she was just a sigh of cotton, there started\r\nblowing a gentle breeze. The cloud was so small and weighed so little that the wind took her\r\nfar away, to a faraway beautiful country, where once again she recovered her original size.\r\nHaving learned this lesson, our cloud remained small and modest, but she became so\r\ngenerous when raining, that her new country became even greener, giving away to all\r\npeople there the most beautiful rainbow in the world.\r\n"

    "description": "Julian finally left his village when there was no one left living there. He had never left his\r\nbeloved village before, but intrigued by the fact that everyone had gone to the city, he\r\ndecided to go and see for himself what wonderful things those cities had. So he packed a\r\nknapsack with a few clothes, put on his best smile, and off he went to the city.\r\nOn reaching the city, he was given a most unexpected welcome. A couple of policemen\r\nstopped Julian and questioned him in great detail. It turned out that Julian had seemed\r\n'suspiciously happy' for someone with hardly any possessions. In the end, the police had to\r\nlet him go, but they were still suspicious about this apparently simple and good-natured\r\nfellow.The first thing Julian noticed about the city was all the rushing around. Everyone was in such\r\na hurry that he thought that there must be something special happening that day, which no\r\none wanted to miss. Curious as to what it was, Julian started following a man who looked\r\nlike he was hurrying to see whatever it was that was happening. However, after several\r\nhours following him, the man arrived at a small flat and went inside. He had done or seen\r\nnothing of interest that whole day.\r\nThat night Julian slept in a park. The park was strewn with bits of paper and plastic. As the\r\nbins were completely empty, Julian thought how cool it was that the city had seemingly\r\ninvented plants with petals made of paper and plastic. He only believed this until the\r\nfollowing morning, when a man came by and dropped his chocolate wrapper.\r\nJulian carried on walking through the city streets, trying to understand what was going on,\r\nwhen he arrived at a group of big warehouses, which many people were entering. \"This\r\nmust be the best museum in the world,\" he thought, on entering, and seeing all the uselesslooking\r\nthings they had inside. But then he saw that people were picking these things up,\r\npaying for them, and taking them away.\r\n\"Why would anyone want a watch which doesn't show the minutes?\" he wondered to\r\nhimself, after seeing a woman very contentedly leaving with the most modern of watches\r\non her wrist. He thought pretty much the same when seeing a pair of shoes with impossibly\r\nhigh heels, and then some electronic device which did a thousand things, and none of them\r\nwell. Once again, he decided to follow the lady with the watch. He saw her joy turn into\r\ndisappointment when her friends gave her new watch a look of disapproval. Julian started\r\nregretting having left his village, just to come to this place where no one seemed happy.\r\nThen he saw a few kids playing. Now, they certainly did seem happy, playing, running about,\r\nchasing each other. Except for one child, who seemed troubled by a little machine they\r\nwere calling a console. He was hitting it so hard with his fingers, and making all kinds of\r\nfaces and angry gestures, that when one of the other children came over to invite him to\r\nplay with them, the boy with the console just rudely walked away. Julian thought that the\r\nboy was trying to destroy that little machine because it was making him so unhappy. He\r\ndecided to help the boy. Julian went over, took the console, threw it on the ground,\r\nstamped on it, and looked at the boy with great satisfaction.At this the boy flew into a rage, as did all the other children there, and nearly all the adults.\r\nThey pursued Julian so relentlessly that he had to run away. He didn't stop running until he\r\nreached the road leading back to his village.\r\nAs he was making his way home he couldn't help wondering whether the whole world had\r\ngone mad."

    "description": "Once, on the African plains, there lived a moody rhino who was very easily angered. One\r\nday, a giant turtle entered the rhino's territory unaware. The rhino quickly ran over to the\r\nturtle, with the intention of getting rid of it. The turtle was frightened and withdrew into its\r\nshell.\r\nWhen the rhino demanded that the turtle get out of his territory, there was no discernible\r\nmovement. The rhino was incredibly annoyed; he thought the turtle was fooling him. So he\r\nstarted banging the shell to make the turtle come out. No success, and his blows got\r\nincreasingly violent. He whacked it with his horn, sending the poor turtle flying in all\r\ndirections. From a distance, it looked a bit like a solitary game of football, with the turtle as\r\nthe ball.\r\nQuite an amusing spectacle, it was, and a load of monkeys soon gathered close by to enjoy\r\nit. They laughed non-stop at the angry rhino and his struggle with the turtle.\r\nThe rhino was so furious that he didn't even notice that they were there. On he went, until\r\nhe had to stop for a second to get his breath.\r\nNow that he wasn't bashing the shell, he could hear the laughing and joking of the monkeys,\r\nwho were making fun of him in every way you can imagine.\r\nNeither the rhino, nor the turtle - who had appeared from his shell -, enjoyed the fact that a\r\ngang of monkeys was mocking them.\r\nSo, they exchanged a knowing look, nodded, and the turtle went back inside his shell. This\r\ntime the rhino very quietly retreated a few steps, looked at the turtle, looked at the\r\nmonkeys, took a run up, and shot the giant turtle, with such a good aim, that it seemed like\r\nhe was using the monkeys as skittles.The 'strike' against the monkeys turned that place into something of a casualty ward for\r\nbaboons. There they all lay, covered in cuts and bruises, and not even a smirk crossed their\r\nlips. Meanwhile, off went the rhino and the turtle, smiling like old friends... and while the\r\nmonkeys were putting on their sticking plasters, their chief realised it was about time they\r\nfound a better way to amuse themselves than making fun of others.\r\n"

It was as white as driven snow, its petals looked like\r\nvelvet, and the morning dew shone from its leaves like resplendent crystals. The flower\r\ncouldn\u2019t see herself, so she had no idea how pretty she was. And so it was that she spent\r\nthe few days of her life, until wilting set on, without knowing that all around her were\r\namazed by her and her perfection: her perfume, the softness of her petals, her elegance.\r\nShe didn\u2019t realise that everyone who saw her spoke well of her. The weeds that surrounded\r\nher were fascinated by her beauty, and lived in a state of enchantment at her aroma and\r\nappearance.\r\nOne hot, sunny day, a girl was strolling through the garden, thinking about how many lovely\r\nthings Mother Nature has given us, when she suddenly saw a white rose in a forgotten part\r\nof the garden. The rose was beginning to fade and wilt.\r\n-\u201CIt\u2019s days since it rained,\u201D\r\nshe thought,\r\n-\u201Cif the rose stays here till tomorrow it'll be totally withered. I\u2019ll take it home and put it in\r\nthe lovely vase I got as a present.\u201D\r\nAnd so she did. With all her love she put the wilting white rose in water, inside a lovely\r\ncolourful glass vase, and placed it by the window.\r\n-\"I'll put it here,\"\r\nshe thought,\r\n-\"so the flower can get some sun.\"\r\nWhat the young girl didn\u2019t realise was that the reflection from the window meant that, for\r\nthe first time, the rose got to see herself and what she looked like.\r\n-\u201CIs that me?\u201D\r\nthought the rose. Little by little her drooping leaves began to rise, once again stretching up\r\ntowards the sun, and, gradually, the rose recovered her former appearance. When she wastotally back to her best she looked at her reflection and saw that she was indeed a beautiful\r\nflower. She thought\r\n-\"Wow! Till now I hadn\u2019t realised who I was, how could I have been so blind?\u201D\r\nThe rose came to realise she had spent her days without appreciating her beauty, unable to\r\nsee herself, unable to know who she really was.\r\nIf you really want to know who you are, forget everything that\u2019s around you, and just look\r\ninto your heart."

The dwarf spent some days there, watching and listening, until\r\ntheir was another theft. The following morning the wise dwarf made all the palace\r\ninhabitants meet up together in the same room. After inspecting them for the whole\r\nmorning, and during lunch, without saying a word, the dwarf started asking them all, one by\r\none, what they knew about the stolen jewels.\r\nOnce again, it seemed that no one had been the thief. But then, suddenly, one of the\r\ngardeners began coughing, writhing and moaning, and finally he fell to the floor.\r\nThe dwarf, with a cheeky smile, explained that the food they had just eaten was poisoned,\r\nand the only antidote for this poison was hidden inside the ruby that had been stolen the\r\nprevious night. And he explained how, some days earlier, he himself had swapped some\r\nfalse rubies for the genuine ones, and that he expected that only the thief would be able to\r\nsave his life, since the poison was particularly quick working\u2026\r\nThe coughs and groans spread around the room, and terror took hold of all present. All\r\nexcept one person. A footman didn\u2019t take long to run over to where he had hidden the\r\njewels, from where he took the final ruby. Fortunately he would be able to open it and drink\r\nthe strange liquid inside, thus saving his life.Or so he believed, because the gardener was, in fact, one of the dwarf\u2019s assistants, and the\r\npoison was nothing more than a potion prepared by the little investigator to cause a few\r\nstrong pains for a short while, but nothing more than that. And the footman, now found\r\nout, was arrested by the guards and taken immediately to court.\r\nThe King, grateful, generously rewarded his wise adviser, and when he asked the dwarf\r\nwhat his secret was, the dwarf smiled and said:\r\n-\u201CI only try to get the person knowing the truth to reveal that truth.\u201D\r\n-\u201CAnd who knew it?

You forgot the eyes again!\u2019\r\n\u2018Oh, yeah.\u2019\r\n\u2018Hmmm, I think I\u2019m going to have to teach you how to draw until you can do me well,\u2019 said\r\nthe circle with its quick, squeaky little voice.\r\nTo Pinty, who remained almost paralysed with shock, this did not seem like a bad idea, and\r\nhe immediately found himself drawing and erasing circles. The circle would not stop saying\r\n\u2018rub this out, but carefully; it hurts,\u2019 or \u2018draw me some hair, quickly, I look like a lollipop!\u2019\r\nand other funny remarks.\r\nAfter spending nearly the whole afternoon together, Pinty could already draw the little\r\nfigure much better than most of his classmates could have. He was enjoying it so much that\r\nhe did not want to stop drawing with this crazy new teacher of his. Before going to bed that\r\nnight, Pinty gave his new instructor a hearty thank you for having taught him how to draw\r\nso well.\r\n\u2018But I didn\u2019t do anything, silly!\u2019 answered the little drawing, in its usual quick manner.\r\n\u2018Don\u2019t you see that you\u2019ve been practicing a lot, and enjoying it all the while? I bet that\u2019s the\r\nfirst time you\u2019ve done that!\u2019\r\nPinty stopped to think. The truth was that previously, he had drawn so badly because he\r\nhad never practiced more than ten minutes at a time, and he had always done it angrily and\r\ngrudgingly. Without doubt, what the little drawing had said was correct.\r\n\u2018OK, you\u2019re right, but thank you anyway,\u2019 said Pinty, and before he went to bed he carefully\r\nplaced the pencil in his school bag.\r\nThe next morning Pinty jumped out of bed and went running to find his pencil, but it was\r\nnot there. He searched everywhere, but there was no sign of it. And the sheet of paper on\r\nwhich he had drawn the little figure, although still full of rubbing out marks, was completely\r\nblank. Pinty began to worry, and he did not know if he had really spent the previous\r\nafternoon talking with the little man or whether he had dreamt the whole thing.\r\nSo, to try to settle the matter, he took a pencil and some paper and tried to draw a little\r\nman.It turned out not bad at all, except for a couple of jagged lines. He imagined his bossy little\r\nteacher telling him to round out those edges, and that it looked like he was trying to give\r\nhim spots. Pinty gladly rubbed out those bits and redrew them. He realised that the crazy\r\nlittle teacher had been right: it made no difference whether you had the magic pencil or not;\r\nto manage to do things, you only needed to keep trying and to enjoy doing so.\r\nFrom that day on, whenever Pinty tried to draw or paint, or do anything else, he always had\r\nfun imagining the result of his work protesting to him and saying \u2018Come on, my friend, do\r\nme a bit better than that! I can\u2019t go to the party looking like this!\u2019"

    "title": "THE SINGING HIPPO",
    "description": "Once upon a time, a hippopotamus lived in a river next to a big and solitary tree.\r\nOne day, a bird came and nested in the tree. The songs and the flight of the bird caused\r\nsuch envy in the hippo that he couldn't think of anything else. Every day he would lament\r\nthe fact that he had been born a hippo. This, despite the many times the bird told the hippo\r\nhe was so lucky to be so big and such a good swimmer.\r\nFinally, the hippo made his mind up that he would come out of the river, climb the tree, go\r\nout to perch on a branch, and start singing. However, when he tried to climb the tree it was\r\nall too clear that the hippo didn't have wings, nor claws to climb with, and neither could he\r\nhop.\r\nRealising that he would never manage it, he angrily rammed his whole weight against the\r\ntree until it came crashing to the ground. Then, triumphantly, he stepped onto the leaves of\r\nthe fallen tree, and began singing.\r\nUnfortunately, hippos can't sing either. All that came from his mouth were horrible noises,\r\nand when the other animals heard this they all gathered round to make fun of the hippo\r\nstanding on the branch of a fallen tree, trying to sing like a bird.\r\nHe was so embarrassed by this that he decided to never again regret being a hippo. He also\r\nfelt bad about having knocked the tree over. He used all his strength to raise the tree back\r\nup again, replant it, and look after it until it had completely recovered."

    "title": "THE INCREDIBLE BLACK RAIN",
    "description": "Gus Grumplings was never happy with anything. He had lots of friends, and parents who\r\nloved him dearly, but all Gus could think about was what he didn't have, or things he did\r\nhave which he was unhappy with. If someone gave him a car, it would be too big or too\r\nslow. If he went to the zoo, he'd come back disappointed because they hadn't let him feed\r\nthe lions. If he played football with his friends, he would complain, saying there were too\r\nmany of them for just one ball...\r\nWhat caught Gus unawares was Chuckles the prankster cloud. One day, Chuckles was\r\ndrifting past, and heard all of Gus's complaining. Chuckles wafted over to see. When the\r\ncloud was right above Gus, he started dropping heavy black rain on him. That was Chuckles'\r\nfavourite trick to play on grumpy little kids.\r\nGus wasn't at all impressed by this new development; it just made him complain even more.\r\nHe was even angrier after he realised that the cloud was following him.\r\nWell, this carried on for almost a week. Gus couldn't get away from the cloud, and he got\r\nmore and more infuriated.\r\nGus had a little friend, a happy and generous girl called Gladys. Gladys was the only one who\r\nhad been willing to hang around with Gus during all those black, rainy days. All the other\r\nchildren had run off to avoid getting soaked and ending up completely black.\r\nOne day, when Gus was at the end of his tether, she said to him: \"Cheer up! What you\r\nshould realise is that you're the only one of us who has his very own cloud, and even better,\r\nits rain is black! We could play some fun games with a cloud like this, don't you reckon?\" As\r\nGladys was his only company these days, and he didn't want her to leave as the others had,\r\nGus reluctantly agreed.\r\nGladys took him to the swimming pool, and left him there until all the pool water was black.\r\nThen she went and got other kids. They came and played in the pool. The water being black\r\nmeant they could play hide and seek! Grudgingly, Gus had to admit it had been a lot of fun,\r\nbut what was even more fun was playing Wet the Cat.\r\nGus would find cats and run alongside them. When the cats felt themselves getting wet they\r\nwould jump about in the craziest way, and run off at top speed, with funny looks on their faces. Before long, all the children in town had gathered around Gus, thinking up new games\r\nthey could play using the cloud.\r\nFor the first time ever, Gus started to see the positive side of things; even things which, at\r\nfirst, had seemed so bad. Chuckles, the prankster cloud, thought that he could now leave;\r\nhis work had been done. But, before leaving, he gave Gus two days of multicoloured rain,\r\nwith which the children invented the most fun games ever.\r\nWhen Chuckles finally left, Gus didn't complain. Now he knew to focus on the good in life,\r\nand the good thing about Chuckles' departure was that no longer was Gus soaking wet all\r\nday. Now he could go and do dry things, and that's exactly what he did."

    "title": "MY LITTLE WORLD HAS BROKEN",
    "description": "Once upon a time there was a spring who lived happily and safely inside a pen. Although he\r\nheard many noises coming from outside, he lived believing that outside his world inside the\r\npen, there was nothing good. Even just to think about leaving his pen made him so scared\r\nthat he was quite content to spend his life compacting and stretching himself again and\r\nagain inside that tiny space.\r\nHowever, one day, the ink ran out, and when the pen's owner was busy changing it, there\r\nwas an accident. The spring was flung through the air and landed in the toilet drain, well out\r\nof sight. Terrified, and cursing his bad luck, the spring was flushed through pipe after pipe,\r\neach time thinking it might be his end. During the journey, he did not dare open his eyes out\r\nof pure fear. Nor did he every stop crying. Swept away by the water, he travelled on and on\r\nand on, until he ended up in a river. When the river current lost its force, and the spring\r\ncould see that things had calmed down a bit, he stopped crying and listened all around him.\r\nHearing birdsong and wind in the trees, he felt encouraged to finally open his eyes. What\r\nthe spring saw was the pure, crystal waters of the river, the rich green rocks of the riverbed,\r\nand all kinds of fish of many colours, whose skin seemed to dance under the sunlight. Now\r\nhe understood that the world was much greater than the space inside the pen, and that\r\nthere had always been many things outside, waiting to be enjoyed.\r\nAfter spending a while playing with the fish, he went over to the riverbank, and then moved\r\non to a field of flowers. There he heard weeping. He followed the sound, which took him to\r\na lovely flower that had been flattened by a rabbit, and could no longer stand up straight.\r\nThe spring realised that he could help the flower, so he offered to be his support. The floweraccepted, and slipped through the middle of the spring. There they lived happily together.\r\nAnd they would always laugh when remembering how the spring used to think that all there\r\nwas to life was being a sad and fearful spring."

    "title": "THE UNFRIENDLY RIVER",
    "description": "Once upon a time there was a river. This river was rather unfriendly and lonesome. The river\r\ncould not remember how long ago he had decided that he no longer wanted to put up with\r\nanything or anyone. He lived alone, refusing to share his water with any fish, plant or\r\nanimal.\r\nAnd so his life went on, sadly and filled with loneliness, for many centuries.\r\nOne day, a little girl with a goldfish bowl came to the bank of this river. In the bowl lived\r\nScamp, her favourite little fish. The girl was about to move to another country, and she\r\nwouldn't be able to take Scamp with her. So she had decided to give Scamp his freedom.\r\nWhen Scamp fell into the river, he immediately felt the river's loneliness. Scamp tried talking\r\nto the river, but the river told Scamp to go away. Now, Scamp was a very happy little fish,\r\nand he wasn't going to give up so easily. He asked and asked, swam and swam, and finally\r\nhe started jumping in and out of the water.\r\nThe river, feeling all the jumping and splashing, started to laugh. It tickled!\r\nAfter a while, this put the river in such a good mood that he started talking to Scamp.\r\nAlmost without knowing it, by the end of that day, Scamp and the river had become very\r\ngood friends.\r\nThe river spent that night thinking about how much fun it was to have friends, and how\r\nmuch he had missed by not having them. He asked himself why he had never had them, but\r\nhe couldn't remember.\r\nThe next morning, Scamp woke the river with a few playful splashes... and that was when\r\nthe river remembered why he had decided to be such an unfriendly river:\r\nHe remembered that he was very ticklish, and that he wouldn't have been able to stand it!\r\nNow he remembered perfectly how he had told everyone to scoot, that he wasn't going to\r\nput up with all that tickling.But, remembering how sad and lonely he had felt for so many years, the river realised that\r\nalthough it may sometimes be a bit inconvenient or uncomfortable, it was always better to\r\nhave friends and to try to be happy.\r\n"

    "title": "THE TICKLING SCALES",
    "description": "One day, in the jungle, a set of bathroom scales appeared. The animals played with it for\r\nquite some time until a parrot who had escaped from the zoo explained to them how it\r\nworked. All the animals took turns to weigh themselves. At first this was a big game; every\r\nday each animal would see how much weight they had gained or lost. However, before long,\r\nmany animals began to obsess about their weight. The first thing they would do each day\r\nwould be to run to the scales, weigh themselves, and spend the rest of the day with a\r\ngrumpy expression on their faces. This because, no matter what the scales said, the animals\r\nalways weighed the same, in other words: \"more than they wanted to\".\r\nAs the months passed, the scales began to suffer the animals\u2019 disapproval. The scales were\r\nregularly kicked, or given poisonous looks. One day, the scales decided that from the\r\nfollowing morning things would have to change.\r\nThat morning, the first to run to weigh itself was the zebra. However, as soon as it stepped\r\nonto the scales, the scales began tickling the zebra\u2019s hooves. Soon the scales found just the\r\nright spot, and the zebra couldn\u2019t stop giggling. This was so much fun for the zebra that from\r\nthat day on it no longer worried about its weight, and off it went to happily eat its breakfast\r\nfor the first time in ages. The same happened to whoever went to weigh themselves that\r\nday... so that, before long, no one was worried any longer about their weight. Rather, they\r\nall commented on how much fun the scales and its tickling were.\r\nAs the months and the years passed, the scales stopped reading weight and began reading\r\ngood humour and optimism instead. Soon everyone happily discovered that this was a much\r\nbetter indicator of beauty and a person\u2019s value. Finally, in the jungle everyone forgot about\r\nthat antiquated and old-fashioned measurement known as the kilo.\r\n"

    "title": "A DAY WITH PIGS",
    "description": "There was once a boy who would never get dressed when his parents told him to, nor would\r\nhe put on what they wanted him to after his bath. He preferred to dress in a much stranger\r\nmanner, but above all, he liked to take his time. His parents were always in a rush, andwanted him to be a lot quicker, but the boy didn't like this, and he would slow down even\r\nmore.\r\nOne day, his parents were in their usual hurry, and they got so angry when he refused to\r\ndress, that they told him that he would have to go out naked. The boy didn't mind this in the\r\nleast. So out they went.\r\nWhile the boy was standing naked outside his house, waiting for his parents to bring the car,\r\nalong came the local pig farmer. The pig farmer was hard of hearing and had poor eyesight.\r\nNot only that, but he'd also forgotten to put his glasses on that day. When he saw the little\r\nboy's pink skin, he thought it was one of his pigs. And, with a bit of shouting, prodding, and\r\npushing, the farmer managed to get the boy safely back to a pigsty.\r\nThe boy protested the whole way there, but as the farmer was almost deaf, his complaints\r\ndidn't help him. And there he was for the whole day, living amongst the pigs, thought to be\r\na pig, and sharing their food and home.\r\nFinally, though, his parents found him. The boy had had such a regrettable day that never\r\nagain did he want to be mistaken for anything other than a human being. Nowadays he's\r\nthe first to get dressed, and look perfectly neat and tidy, just like those children in the\r\nclothes catalogues"

    "title": "THE WARM WHALE",
    "description": "Gail the Whale lived in a small salty lake. She was the only whale in that territory, and she\r\nled a very comfortable life. In fact, this easy life made her a bit fussy. But, one year, there\r\nwas such an incredibly hot summer that the lake's water really warmed up. Gail, used to\r\nsuch an ideal existence, could hardly stand the hot water. A little fish, which had spent some\r\ntime in a child's goldfish bowl, told Gail that humans used fans to cool themselves down in\r\nsummer. From then on, Gail the Whale couldn't think of anything else apart from how to\r\nbuild her very own fan.\r\nEveryone told her that she was overreacting, and that the hot weather would soon pass, but\r\nGail got to work, constructing her enormous fan. When it was finally finished, she started\r\nfanning away at herself.Unlucky for the fish! The giant fan beat the little lake's waters so strongly that huge waves\r\nrolled right across it. The waves crashed onto the lakeshore, leaving the lake half empty, and\r\nGail stranded in only a few inches of water.\r\n\"You couldn't just hang on for while. You had to empty the lake,\" some unhappy-looking fish\r\nberated her. \"So impatient! So selfish!\" others shouted. But the worst of it for Gail was not\r\nthe insults, but the fact that with so little water around her, the heat was becoming\r\nunbearable. Preparing herself to die of heatstroke, she said her goodbyes to all her friends,\r\nand they asked for her forgiveness. She assured them all that if she were to live again she\r\nwould be stronger and learn to put up with life's discomforts.\r\nYet, once again, Gail the Whale was overreacting. She managed to survive those hot days\r\nwithout dying, although, of course, she suffered. When the next rains arrived, the lake filled\r\nup again, and the weather improved. Naturally, Gail had to keep her promise, and show\r\neveryone that she had learned not to be so dependent on comfort, so impatient, and so\r\nfussy.\r\n"

    "title": "THE MAGIC WINDOW",
    "description": "Once upon a time there was a little boy who became very ill. He had to spend all day in bed,\r\nunable to move. Because other children weren't allowed to come near him, he suffered\r\ngreatly, and spent his days feeling sad and blue.\r\nThere wasn't much he could do except look out of the window. Time passed, and his feeling\r\nof despair just grew. Until one day he saw a strange shape in the window. It was a penguin\r\neating a sausage sandwich. The penguin squeezed in through the open window, said \"good\r\nafternoon\" to the boy, turned around, and left again.\r\nOf course, the boy was very surprised. He was still trying to work out what had happened,\r\nwhen outside his window he saw a monkey in a nappy, busy blowing up a balloon. At first\r\nthe boy asked himself what that could possibly be, but after a while, as more and more\r\ncrazy-looking characters appeared out the window, he burst out laughing and found it hard\r\nto stop.\r\nAnyone wanting to stop laughing would never be helped by seeing a pig playing a\r\ntambourine, an elephant jumping on a trampoline, or a dog wearing a pair of glasses and\r\ntalking about nothing except politics. The little boy didn't tell anyone about this because\r\nwho would have believed him? Even so, those strange characters ended up putting joy back in his heart, and in his body. Before long, his health had improved so much that he was able\r\nto go back to school again.\r\nThere he got to talk to his friends, and tell them all the strange things he had seen. While he\r\nwas talking to his best friend he saw something sticking out of his friend's school bag. The\r\nboy asked his friend what it was, and he was so insistent that finally his friend had to show\r\nhim what was in the bag:\r\nThere, inside, were all the fancy-dress suits and disguises that his best friend had been using\r\nto try to cheer the little boy up!\r\nAnd from that day on, the little boy always did his best to make sure that no one felt sad\r\nand alone."
